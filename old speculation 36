MBT Simulation: Tool Creation & Scientific Knowledge Expansion
1. Tool Creation Logic

Tools are emergent artifacts generated when agents interact with high-resource or memory-rich zones. 
These tools amplify motion precision and memory retention, and can be passed between generations.


tool_map = np.zeros_like(field)
tool_influence = 0.003
tool_decay = 0.995

# Tool emergence: If memory is high and environment is stable
tool_seeds = (memory > 0.04) & (np.abs(laplacian(field)) < 0.01)
tool_map[tool_seeds] += 0.02

# Spread tool influence and decay
tool_map = gaussian_filter(tool_map, sigma=2)
tool_map *= tool_decay

# Tool impact
field += tool_map * tool_influence
memory += tool_map * 0.0002

2. Scientific Observation and Law Discovery

When agents repeatedly experience similar environmental cycles or field behaviors, they accumulate 'observed truths.'
These truths manifest as structured symbolic memory or proto-laws and influence agent decision-making.


knowledge_map = np.zeros_like(field)
observation_stability = (np.abs(field - gaussian_filter(field, sigma=2)) < 0.003)
repeated_exposure = (memory > 0.035) & observation_stability
knowledge_map[repeated_exposure] += 0.01

# Knowledge sharing through proximity
knowledge_map = gaussian_filter(knowledge_map, sigma=1.5)
memory += knowledge_map * 0.0003

3. Knowledge Codification into Symbols

After accumulating enough repeated patterns, families may encode them into symbolic communication channels. 
These become the foundation for scientific 'laws' or recorded discoveries.


for fid, sym in family_symbols.items():
    if np.mean(knowledge_map[family_id_map == fid]) > 0.01:
        symbol_maps[sym] += knowledge_map * 0.005
