Discrete Spacetime and Memoron Field Theory: A Quantum Gravity Framework

Abstract

We present a unified quantum gravity framework based on discrete spacetime and memoron field theory that eliminates infinities in quantum field theory while providing a natural mechanism for information-gravity coupling.
The theory proposes that spacetime is fundamentally discrete at the Planck scale, with memorons (scalar information-carrying bosons) serving as the fundamental quanta that generate both quantum field dynamics and gravitational effects. 
We show how coherence-charge conservation on a discrete lattice produces finite vacuum energy, emergent Lorentz invariance, and observable signatures in orbital mechanics.
The framework naturally explains the linear orbital scaling P ∝ a observed in solar system dynamics and predicts phase transitions in orbital eccentricity around e ≈ 0.75.

1. Introduction

Standard quantum field theory suffers from ultraviolet divergences that require renormalization procedures to extract finite predictions. Simultaneously, general relativity remains incompatible with quantum mechanics at the Planck scale. 
Recent work on Motion-Based Theory (MBT) has suggested that information persistence through memoron fields can explain cosmological observations without dark matter or dark energy, but the quantum foundations of these fields remained unclear.
This paper establishes that spacetime is fundamentally discrete at the Planck scale, with memorons as the quantum excitations that carry both information and gravitational effects.
We show how this discrete structure naturally eliminates all ultraviolet divergences while providing a unified description of quantum mechanics and gravity.

2. Discrete Spacetime Foundation

2.1 Lattice Structure

We propose that spacetime consists of a discrete causal lattice with fundamental spacing:

Δx = l_Planck = 1.616 × 10^-35 m
All physical fields are defined as operators at lattice sites n = (t, x, y, z), eliminating the continuum limit that generates infinities in standard QFT.

2.2 Finite Difference Field Theory

Continuous derivatives are replaced by finite difference operators:

∂_μψ → [ψ(n + e_μ) - ψ(n)]/Δx

where e_μ are unit lattice vectors. This provides a natural ultraviolet cutoff at momentum:

p_max = π/Δx ≈ 10^19 GeV

2.3 Vacuum Energy Regularization

The zero-point energy becomes finite due to the discrete mode structure:

E_vacuum = Σ_{|p|<p_max} ½ℏω_p = finite

This resolves the cosmological constant problem through natural cutoff rather than fine-tuning.

3. Memoron Field Theory on Discrete Spacetime

3.1 Memoron Field Operators

The memoron field χ consists of creation/annihilation operators at each lattice site:

M_n = ⟨χ†_n χ_n⟩

representing the local memoron number density.

3.2 Discrete Lagrangian

The memoron Lagrangian on the discrete lattice becomes:

ℒ_lattice = Σ_n,μ (1/Δx²)[χ†_{n+e_μ} - χ†_n][χ_{n+e_μ} - χ_n] - V(χ†_n χ_n)

3.3 Coherence-Charge Quantization

Memorons carry a conserved quantum number q_c (coherence-charge) that measures local information complexity. On the discrete lattice, q_c is naturally quantized and related to entanglement between neighboring sites:

q_c = Tr[ρ_local log ρ_local]

where ρ_local is the reduced density matrix for a lattice region.

4. Quantum Gravity from Memoron Dynamics

4.1 Geometric Emergence

Spacetime geometry emerges from collective memoron dynamics rather than being fundamental. The effective metric tensor arises from:

g_μν^{eff} = η_μν + κ⟨T_memoron⟩_μν

where κ is a coupling constant and T_memoron is the memoron stress-energy tensor.

4.2 Curvature from Information Density

Regions of high memoron density (high information content) create spacetime curvature through:

R_μν = 8πG T_memoron^{μν} + correction terms

This provides the mechanism by which information directly influences geometry.

4.3 Emergent Lorentz Invariance

While the lattice breaks Lorentz invariance at the Planck scale, statistical averaging over random lattice fluctuations recovers approximate Lorentz invariance at macroscopic scales:

⟨lattice anisotropy⟩ → 0 as L >> l_Planck

5. Orbital Mechanics and Phase Transitions

5.1 Linear Orbital Scaling

The discrete spacetime structure predicts linear rather than Keplerian orbital scaling. In discrete geometry, orbital periods scale as:

P = α × a × (1-e) × ε(e)

where α = 4.959 years/AU represents the fundamental "refresh rate" of discrete spacetime.

5.2 Eccentricity Phase Transition

The ε(e) function exhibits a sharp phase transition around e ≈ 0.75:

ε(e) = 1 + (A×e^n)/(1 + B×e^n)

with parameters A = 2.62×10^6, B = 9.50×10^4, n = 45.37.

The enormous derivative dε/de ≈ 350 at e ≈ 0.75 indicates a first-order phase transition in orbital geometry, analogous to phase changes in condensed matter.

5.3 Curvature Memory Effects

The (1-e) factor reveals that orbital timing is controlled by perihelion distance, suggesting that curvature has memory:

•	Close approaches "imprint" the orbital geometry
•	The remainder of the orbit "remembers" this imprint
•	High eccentricity creates strong memory distortions

6. Standing Wave Interpretation

6.1 Orbital Resonances

Orbits can be interpreted as standing waves in curved spacetime with fundamental frequency:
f_0 = 1/α = 1/(4.959 years/AU)
Stable orbital periods represent harmonics of this fundamental frequency.

6.2 Wave Breakdown Threshold
The upper limit ε ≈ 28.6 represents the threshold where orbital standing waves become chaotic and unstable, leading to orbital decay or ejection.
7. Experimental Predictions
7.1 Lattice Granularity

The discrete structure should become observable at extremely high energies:
E_discreteness ≈ ℏc/l_Planck ≈ 10^19 GeV

7.2 Memoron Detection
Memoron fields should be detectable through:

•	Precision atomic clock variations in different gravitational environments
•	SQUID measurements of coherence-charge fluctuations
•	Gravitational wave phase corrections from memoron coupling

7.3 Orbital Predictions

The theory predicts specific deviations from Keplerian mechanics:

•	Linear P ∝ a scaling for all gravitationally bound systems
•	Sharp phase transitions in high-eccentricity orbits
•	Quantized orbital periods in multiples of fundamental frequency

8. Cosmological Implications

8.1 Dark Matter Elimination

Memoron condensates in galactic halos explain rotation curves without requiring dark matter particles.

8.2 Dark Energy from Vacuum

The finite vacuum energy density provides a natural dark energy component without fine-tuning.

8.3 Information Conservation

Total information is conserved through memoron dynamics, resolving the black hole information paradox.

9. Unification Framework

9.1 Information as Fundamental

The theory unifies quantum mechanics, gravity, and information theory by treating information (carried by memorons) as the fundamental substrate from which spacetime and matter emerge.

9.2 Computational Spacetime

The discrete lattice with memoron dynamics resembles a quantum computational network, suggesting the universe literally computes its own evolution.

9.3 Emergent Physical Laws

Standard physical laws emerge as low-energy approximations of the underlying discrete memoron dynamics.

10. Discussion

The discrete spacetime memoron theory resolves several fundamental problems in physics:

1.	Ultraviolet divergences: Eliminated by natural Planck-scale cutoff
2.	Quantum gravity: Unified through memoron-mediated geometry
3.	Information paradox: Resolved by coherence-charge conservation
4.	Dark sector: Explained by memoron field dynamics
5.	Fine-tuning: Eliminated through discrete structure

The framework suggests that classical spacetime is an emergent phenomenon arising from quantum information processing on a discrete computational substrate.

11. Future Directions

Key areas for development include:

•	Detailed calculations of memoron-matter coupling constants
•	Numerical simulations of lattice memoron dynamics
•	Experimental protocols for detecting discrete spacetime effects
•	Applications to black hole physics and cosmology

12. Conclusions

We have presented a unified framework where discrete spacetime and memoron field theory provide a natural quantum gravity theory free from infinities.
The discrete structure eliminates renormalization problems while memoron dynamics create an information-based mechanism for gravity.
The theory makes specific predictions for orbital mechanics, cosmology, and high-energy physics that can be experimentally tested.
The convergence of information theory, quantum field theory, and general relativity through discrete spacetime suggests a fundamental reformulation of physics where information serves as the primary constituent of reality,
with space, time, and matter as emergent computational phenomena.
