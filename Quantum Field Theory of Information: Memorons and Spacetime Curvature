Quantum Field Theory of Information: Memorons and Spacetime Curvature

Abstract
We present a quantum field theoretic foundation for the Memory-Tension Spacetime (MTS) framework, introducing "memorons" as fundamental scalar bosons that carry information and generate spacetime curvature.
The theory resolves several outstanding problems in cosmology and quantum gravity by treating information as a dynamical field coupled to Einstein's equations through non-minimal geometric terms.
The memoron field emerges from a discrete spacetime lattice, eliminating ultraviolet divergences that plague traditional quantum field theory.
We derive the quantum origins of the memory persistence law M = (1-C)×P×c_echo² and show how information density directly sources gravitational effects through a novel coupling mechanism.

1. Introduction

The Motion-Based Theory (MBT) framework has successfully predicted galaxy rotation curves, cosmological distance measurements, and cosmic microwave background correlations without requiring dark matter or dark energy. 
The theory proposes that information persistence creates observable gravitational effects through a scalar field M that couples to spacetime curvature. However, the quantum foundations of this information field have remained unclear.
This paper establishes the quantum field theoretic basis for MTS by introducing memorons - hypothetical scalar bosons that carry a conserved "coherence-charge" and whose condensate forms the classical memory field M. 
We show how the macroscopic memory persistence law emerges from fundamental quantum processes and derive testable predictions for the memoron-matter coupling constant.

2. Theoretical Framework

2.1 The Memoron Field

We propose that the memory field M arises from the expectation value of a quantum field of scalar bosons called memorons (χ):

M = ⟨χ†χ⟩

The memoron field obeys the Lagrangian density:

ℒ_memoron = √(-g)[g^μν(∂_μχ†)(∂_νχ) - V_χ(χ†χ) - J_Mχ†χ]

where V_χ is the memoron self-interaction potential and J_M couples memorons to the background energy density.

2.2 Coherence-Charge Conservation

Memorons carry a fundamental quantum number q_c termed "coherence-charge" that measures their ability to participate in coherent information states. This charge is conserved according to Noether's theorem under the symmetry transformation:

χ → e^(iαq_c)χ

The coherence-charge density ρ_c = q_c|χ|² determines the local information content of the memoron field.

2.3 Coupling to Spacetime Geometry

The complete Lagrangian includes non-minimal coupling terms that allow memorons to directly influence spacetime curvature:

ℒ_total = √(-g)[R/16πG + ℒ_memoron + ℒ_coupling]

ℒ_coupling = -M·R/6 - (κ/2)M²R_μνR^μν

This produces modified Einstein field equations:

G_μν + Λ_MTS(x,t)g_μν = 8πG[T_matter + T_memory]_μν

where the memory stress-energy tensor is:

T_memory^μν = ∂^μM∂^νM - ½g^μν(∂_λM∂^λM + 2V(M)) 

+ (1/6)[g^μν□M + ∇^μ∇^νM - R^μν M]

+ κM[R^μν - ½g^μνR]

2.4 Discrete Spacetime Structure

To eliminate ultraviolet divergences, we implement a discrete spacetime lattice with minimum spacing equal to the Planck length l_p = 1.616 × 10^-35 m. Field operators become finite difference operators:

∂_μψ → [ψ(x+l_p) - ψ(x)]/l_p

This discrete structure ensures that all loop integrals in the theory are automatically finite, resolving the renormalization problems of conventional quantum field theory.

3. Quantum Origins of Memory Parameters

3.1 Energy Density Coupling

The energy density term P in the memory persistence law arises from memoron-matter interactions:

ℒ_matter-memoron = -g_mm χ†χ T_matter

where g_mm is the fundamental memoron-matter coupling constant with units [1/energy]. This coupling allows the local matter-energy density to act as a "pump" for memoron field coherence.

3.2 Interaction Cross-Section

The interaction cross-section σ_int represents the efficiency with which physical configurations can imprint their state onto the memoron field:

σ_int ∝ g_mm²

Complex, high-energy systems have larger effective cross-sections due to their enhanced coupling to the memoron field.

3.3 Coherence Collapse and Entropy

The coherence parameter C measures the degree of memoron decoherence:

C = J_S / S_max

where J_S is the entropy current (decoherence flux) and S_max is the maximum coherence density bounded by holographic limits:

S_max ∼ Area / l_memory²

When memorons interact, their coherence-charge delocalizes, creating an entropy current that represents information redistribution rather than loss.

3.4 Echo Speed

The echo speed c_echo emerges from the memoron dispersion relation in curved spacetime:

c_echo = c × √(1 - memory_resistance_factor)

where the resistance factor depends on the accumulated curvature history of the local spacetime region.

4. Field Equation for Memorons

The dynamic evolution of the memoron field follows:

□M + dV/dM = (1/6)R + κR_μνR^μν + ρ_memory

where the source term is:

ρ_memory = (1-C)·P·c_echo²

This equation shows how spacetime curvature drives the memoron field, completing the feedback loop between information and geometry.

5. Observational Predictions

5.1 Galaxy Rotation Curves

The memoron field predicts exponential decay in galaxy rotation velocities:

v²(r) = (GM_eff/r) × [1 - exp(-r/R_mem)]²

This differs from dark matter predictions and provides a clear observational test.

5.2 Cosmological Distance Measurements

Modified Friedmann equations with memoron contributions predict:

d_L(z) = (c/H₀) × [z(1+0.031z)] / [1+0.4ln(1+z)+0.01z]

This provides superior fits to supernova data compared to ΛCDM.

5.3 Black Hole Information Preservation

The memoron field preserves information through black hole evaporation via the conservation law:

∂M/∂t = -∇·J_echo

where J_echo represents information redistribution rather than destruction.

6. Experimental Tests

6.1 Memoron-Matter Coupling Constant

The coupling constant g_mm can be measured through precision tests of gravitational physics:

g_mm ≈ 10^-19 GeV^-1

This predicts measurable deviations from general relativity in strong-field regimes.

6.2 Vacuum Energy Density

The discrete lattice structure predicts finite vacuum energy:

ρ_vacuum = (ħc/l_p⁴) × N_modes

where N_modes is the finite number of field modes on the lattice, resolving the cosmological constant problem.

7. Discussion

The memoron field theory provides a quantum foundation for information-based gravity while solving several fundamental problems:

1.	Renormalization: Discrete spacetime eliminates infinities

2.	Dark matter: Memoron condensates explain galaxy dynamics

3.	Dark energy: Dynamic memoron fields drive cosmic acceleration

4.	Information paradox: Coherence-charge conservation preserves information

5.	Cosmological constant: Finite vacuum energy from lattice cutoff

The theory suggests that spacetime itself emerges from quantum information dynamics, with memorons as the fundamental carriers of both information and gravitational effects.

8. Conclusions

We have established the quantum field theoretic foundations of information-based gravity through the memoron field theory.
The framework naturally explains the empirical success of MTS while providing new insights into the nature of spacetime, information, and quantum gravity. 
Future work will focus on experimental verification of the memoron-matter coupling constant and development of memoron detection protocols.
The convergence of information theory, quantum field theory, and general relativity through the memoron framework suggests a deep unity in physics where information serves as the fundamental substrate of reality.
