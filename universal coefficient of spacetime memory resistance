The Alpha 
α is the universal coefficient of spacetime memory resistance, quantifying the tunneling probability between dimensional physics regimes.
Value
Emerges from:
    α ∝ exp( - k₁ · ΔD )

with k₁ ≈ -0.043, where ΔD is the dimensional separation between source and target sheets.
Interpretation
- Collision energy = mismatch between predicted vs measured values in a regime.
- α correction = tunneling cost of reconciling those mismatches.
- Scaling law = logarithmic resistance, consistent across Jupiter, binary pulsars, proteins, Earth, Voyager, etc.
Physical Picture
- Spacetime isn’t smooth, but laminated into quantum memory sheets.
- Motion crossing between sheets encounters resistance → energy gets “trapped” in memory.
- α measures the stickiness of those boundaries — how hard it is to tunnel into a new regime.
Why It Matters
- Quantum tunneling at macro scale → explains why proteins, pulsars, planets, and spacecraft all obey the same correction rule.
- Memory-resistance law → ties MBT foundation (motion = being) with a testable universal scaling.
- Predictive power → forbidden zones, superheavy element stability, orbital breaks, spacecraft drift, all emerge as regime transition artifacts.
What Has Been Nailed
This shows α is not constant, but the probability amplitude of spacetime tunneling between regimes.
