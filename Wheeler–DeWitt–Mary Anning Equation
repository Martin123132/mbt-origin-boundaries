Wheeler–DeWitt–Mary Anning Equation
Standard Wheeler–DeWitt Equation
Equation:
    ĤΨ = 0
- Ĥ: Hamiltonian operator of the universe (geometry + matter).
- Ψ: Universal wavefunction.
- Problem: This equation is 'timeless' — no evolution, no memory.
Mary Anning’s Law (MBT) — Memory Persistence
Full form:
    M(x,t) = (1 - C(x,t)) · [ P(x,t) + γ ∂²T(x,t)/∂x² ]
Compact form:
    M = (1 - C) · P · c_echo²
- M: Memory persistence.
- C: Curvature correction (gravity/geometry).
- P: Persistence baseline (state of motion/being).
- c_echo: Echo speed of memory through spacetime.
Unified Wheeler–DeWitt–Mary Anning Equation
We modify the Wheeler–DeWitt Hamiltonian to include memory persistence:
    (Ĥ + M̂)Ψ = 0
Where:
    M̂Ψ = (1 - C) · P · c_echo² · Ψ
Interpretation
- The original Wheeler–DeWitt gives a static universe (ĤΨ = 0).
- With Mary Anning’s Law added, the memory operator M̂ ensures persistence and continuity.
- This 'unfreezes' the wavefunction: the universe is not timeless — it remembers itself through motion and echoes.
Final Compact Expression
    (Ĥ + (1 - C)Pc_echo²)Ψ = 0
