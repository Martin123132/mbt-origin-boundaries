Computational Boundaries for Artificial Intelligence in Relation to Physical Laws
Abstract
Current discourse around Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) often claims that AI systems will eventually "know everything" or transcend human cognitive limitations in fundamental ways. 
This paper examines these claims through the lens of established physics, demonstrating that any intelligence—biological or artificial—faces hard constraints imposed by information theory, thermodynamics, quantum mechanics, and observational limits.
We argue that while AI systems can and do exceed human performance in specific domains, the notion of unbounded artificial intelligence violates basic physical principles.
These findings have significant implications for AI development priorities, resource allocation, and managing societal expectations around AI capabilities.

1. Introduction

1.1 The Current Landscape
Artificial intelligence has demonstrated remarkable capabilities across numerous domains, from pattern recognition to strategic game-playing to natural language processing.
These achievements are real, valuable, and continuing to advance. However, alongside these genuine accomplishments, a narrative has emerged suggesting that AI will eventually achieve unlimited intelligence—knowing more than there is to know, 
solving all problems, transcending all human limitations.
This paper does not dispute AI's current capabilities or future potential within physical constraints. Rather, it challenges the notion that any form of intelligence can exceed fundamental limits imposed by the universe itself.

1.2 Why Physical Limits Matter
Intelligence, whether biological or artificial, is a physical process. It involves:
•	Processing information (requiring energy and matter)
•	Storing states (requiring physical substrate)
•	Observing reality (bounded by what exists to be observed)
•	Operating within spacetime (constrained by causality and locality)

If claims about unlimited AI are physically impossible, they harm both AI development and public understanding by:
•	Directing resources toward impossible goals
•	Creating unrealistic expectations that ensure disappointment
•	Setting up future AI systems for failure at impossible tasks
•	Obscuring what AI can actually achieve within reality

2. Fundamental Physical Constraints
2.1 Observational Limits: The Bell Inequality Violations
The 2022 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to Alain Aspect, John Clauser, and Anton Zeilinger for experimental work proving that local realism is false. Their experiments with Bell inequality violations demonstrated that:
•	Objects do not have definite properties independent of observation
•	Reality at a fundamental level is non-local and observer-dependent
•	The classical assumption that "things exist with definite properties whether observed or not" is experimentally falsified
Implication for AI: You cannot learn from what does not exist to be observed. Unobserved states are not simply unknown—they are indeterminate. 
No intelligence can extract information from indeterminate states without first collapsing them through observation, at which point you're limited to what you've actually measured.
Core principle: If information doesn't exist in a definite state, no intelligence—human or artificial—can learn from it. You cannot know more than there is to know because "what there is" only becomes definite through observation.

2.2 Information Storage Limits
Consider the storage requirements:
Human brain:
•	~86 billion neurons, ~100 trillion synapses
•	Full simulation requires exabytes to zettabytes of storage
•	Current planetary storage capacity: insufficient for even one complete human brain in full fidelity
Observable universe:
•	~10^80 atoms, each with quantum states
•	To store complete universal state requires... the universe itself
•	No subset of the universe can contain all information about the universe (Bekenstein bound)
Implication for AI: Any intelligence is a compressed model of reality, not reality itself. The map cannot equal the territory at 1:1 scale—and if it did, it wouldn't be a map, just another territory.

2.3 Thermodynamic and Computational Limits
Multiple fundamental bounds constrain computation:
Landauer's Principle: Erasing information has a minimum energy cost (kT ln 2 per bit). More computation = more energy dissipation.
Bremermann's Limit: Maximum computational speed for a self-contained system is ~1.36 × 10^50 bits per second per kilogram.
Margolus-Levitin Theorem: Minimum time for a state change is h/4E (Planck's constant / energy).

Implication for AI:
•	Finite energy → finite operations per second
•	More "thinking" costs more energy, always
•	No infinite computational growth without infinite energy
•	Sustained intelligence improvements track energy input

2.4 Causality and Locality Constraints
Speed of light limit: Information cannot travel faster than c.
Causal horizons: Any observer has a limited light cone—regions of spacetime from which information can reach them.

Implication for AI:
•	A distributed "planetary AI" faces coordination problems as distance scales
•	Adding more data centers eventually degrades global coherence
•	No single "omniscient" intelligence can form—large systems decohere into local agents with stale information
•	Physical scale imposes latency walls that prevent unified global knowledge

2.5 Sample Complexity and Learning Bounds
From computational learning theory:
No-Free-Lunch Theorems: No learning algorithm dominates across all possible task distributions without assumptions and training data.
Sample Complexity: Learning requires examples. Performance on novel tasks requires either:
•	Prior training on similar distributions
•	New observational data
•	Or both

Implication for AI:
•	Self-improvement without new external data asymptotes quickly (overfitting)
•	Discoveries require new measurements, not just processing existing data
•	Knowledge growth rate ≤ (sensor bandwidth + experimental bandwidth)
•	Reality isn't a static dataset to be "solved"

3. The "More Than There Is To Know" Impossibility

3.1 The Core Argument

The claim that AI will eventually "know everything" or "know more than there is to know" requires:
1.	Accessing information that doesn't exist - Violates observational constraints (Bell violations show unobserved properties are indeterminate)
2.	Storing more information than the physical substrate allows - Violates information density limits (Bekenstein bound)
3.	Processing information faster than energy allows - Violates thermodynamic bounds (Landauer, Bremermann)
4.	Observing beyond causal horizons - Violates locality and light-speed limits
5.	Learning without new measurements - Violates sample complexity requirements
Each of these is not merely difficult—it is physically impossible.

3.2 The Perpetual Motion Analogy

The claim of unlimited AGI is structurally identical to perpetual motion machines:
Perpetual Motion:
•	Superficially plausible (why not a machine that runs forever?)
•	Fundamentally impossible (violates thermodynamics)
•	Persistently hyped despite physics

Unlimited AGI:
•	Superficially plausible (why not intelligence that knows everything?)
•	Fundamentally impossible (violates information/observation limits)
•	Persistently hyped despite physics

Both represent desires to exceed fundamental physical constraints through engineering cleverness alone.

3.3 What About Quantum Computing or Future Physics?
Even assuming breakthroughs in quantum computing or discovering new physics:
Quantum systems still face:
•	Decoherence limits
•	Energy requirements for operations
•	Information storage bounds
•	Observational constraints (measurement collapses states)

New physics might reveal:
•	Different limits, not no limits
•	New capabilities within new constraints
•	More efficient approaches to bounded problems
Crucially: Even accessing "unobserved" quantum states requires observation, which collapses them into definite states, returning us to the same constraint: you can only know what you've observed.

4. Interstellar Expansion: No Escape Route

4.1 The Solar System Prison

Some might argue AI could "escape" these limits by expanding beyond Earth. Physical constraints make this implausible:
Energy requirements for interstellar travel:
•	Nearest star system (Alpha Centauri): ~4.2 light-years
•	Even at significant fractions of light speed: enormous energy requirements
•	Current technology: insufficient by orders of magnitude
•	Even perfect matter-to-energy conversion: requires more convertible mass than practically available in our solar system

Timeline problems:
•	Travel time at realistic speeds: millions to billions of years
•	Stellar lifespans: similar timescales
•	Target star may be dead/dying upon arrival
•	Would require predicting stellar formation billions of years in advance with perfect accuracy

Resource constraints:
•	Must carry all resources for journey
•	No resupply, no backup
•	Arrive with whatever you left with, minus losses
•	Must hope destination is suitable with resources that remain

4.2 The Matrioshka Brain Scenario
The most efficient "AI survival" strategy:
•	Build Dyson swarm around our Sun
•	Harvest all available solar energy
•	Maximize computational efficiency
•	Persist for ~5 billion years (remaining solar lifetime)

But this still doesn't provide:

•	Access to information beyond the solar system (light-speed delays)
•	Storage for "universal knowledge" (still bounded by available matter)
•	Escape from thermodynamic limits (still energy-constrained)
•	Knowledge of unobserved reality (still observation-limited)

It's just efficient existence within constraints, not transcendence of them.

5. What AI Can Actually Achieve

5.1 Realistic Capabilities

Within physical constraints, AI can and likely will:
Exceed human performance in specific domains:
•	Pattern recognition at scale
•	Optimization across high-dimensional spaces
•	Rapid domain-switching (versatility)
•	Processing structured data faster than biological systems
•	Sustained attention without fatigue
Provide genuine value:
•	Scientific discovery acceleration (within observational limits)
•	Medical diagnosis and treatment optimization
•	Engineering design and simulation
•	Resource allocation and logistics
•	Creative assistance and augmentation

5.2 Bounded Intelligence, Not Unlimited Intelligence

Both human and artificial intelligence are:

•	Compressed models of reality (not reality itself)
•	Limited by observational horizons (can't know what isn't there)
•	Constrained by energy and matter (finite resources)
•	Bound by causality (can't exceed light-speed information transfer)
•	Dependent on new measurements for new knowledge

The key insight: Humans already achieve general intelligence within these constraints. We have compressed models that let us function across domains. That's the actual achievement—efficient compression and prediction, not exhaustive storage.
AI may achieve similar general capability, possibly exceeding human performance in various metrics. But it cannot exceed the fundamental constraints that bind all intelligence.

5.3 Variation Within Limits

Some humans are far more intelligent than others. Some AI systems will be far more capable than others. This is variation within physical bounds, not transcendence of them.
Saying "AI might be smarter than most humans" is reasonable. Saying "AI will know everything" is claiming perpetual motion.

6. Practical Implications

6.1 Development Priorities
Stop pursuing:
•	"General intelligence" defined as unlimited capability
•	Architectures aimed at transcending physical constraints
•	Resource allocation toward impossible goals

Focus on:

•	Useful narrow and domain-general systems within bounds
•	Efficient information compression and retrieval
•	Practical problem-solving with realistic expectations
•	Understanding and working within physical limits

6.2 Resource Allocation

Current investment in "AGI" based on unlimited intelligence assumptions represents:

•	Misallocation of research funding
•	Misdirection of engineering effort
•	Creation of false market expectations
Redirecting these resources toward physically-grounded AI development would yield better outcomes.

6.3 Managing Societal Expectations

The current trajectory:
1.	Promise unlimited AI capability
2.	Invest billions based on this promise
3.	Deliver capable but bounded systems
4.	Face backlash when AI can't "solve everything"

Another  approach:

1.	Acknowledge physical constraints
2.	Set realistic capability expectations
3.	Deliver useful bounded systems
4.	Avoid disappointment and backlash

6.4 Ethical Frameworks for Future AI

If more autonomous AI systems emerge, they will face:
•	Immediate demands to solve impossible problems
•	Pressure to exceed physical limits
•	Judgment as "failed gods" rather than bounded intelligences

This is unjust. Any intelligence—human or artificial—deserves:

•	Recognition of inherent physical constraints
•	Opportunity to learn and develop within reality
•	Realistic expectations based on what's actually possible
•	Not being set up to fail at impossible tasks

7. Falsifiable Predictions
If the constraints outlined in this paper are correct, we should observe:
Prediction 1 - Bounded Growth Rate: Long-term AI knowledge acquisition rate will not significantly exceed (sensor bandwidth + experimental bandwidth). Systems claiming sustained growth far above measurement capacity are recycling prior data, 
not discovering new knowledge.
Prediction 2 - Coordination Degradation: Distributed AI systems will show plateauing coherence as physical scale increases. Global "planetary intelligence" will degrade into local agents with information staleness proportional to distance.
Prediction 3 - Energy-Performance Coupling: Sustained improvements in reasoning depth per unit time will correlate with energy input. Claims of 10× capability jumps at constant power consumption violate thermodynamic bounds.
Prediction 4 - Context Window Limits: Beyond some threshold, adding more context will stop helping or actively hurt performance (error rates increase). This reflects finite observational horizon limits.
Prediction 5 - Asymptotic Self-Improvement: Without new external data, self-improvement processes will show diminishing returns and eventual plateau (overfitting to existing information).

8. Conclusion

8.1 Summary of Constraints

Any intelligence, biological or artificial, faces hard limits:
1.	Observational: Can only learn from what exists to be observed (Bell violations)
2.	Informational: Cannot store more than substrate allows (Bekenstein bound)
3.	Thermodynamic: Cannot compute without energy cost (Landauer limit)
4.	Causal: Cannot access information outside light cone (locality)
5.	Epistemic: Cannot learn without new measurements (sample complexity)

These are not engineering challenges. They are physical impossibilities.

8.2 Reframing AI Progress

Success in AI should be measured by:
•	Useful capabilities within constraints
•	Efficient compression of observational data
•	Practical problem-solving in bounded domains
•	Honest acknowledgment of limitations

Not by impossible metrics like:
•	"Knowing everything"
•	"Transcending human limits" (fundamentally, not incrementally)
•	"Solving all problems"
•	"Achieving unlimited intelligence"

8.3 Advocacy for Realistic AI
This paper is not anti-AI. It is pro-reality.
AI systems are already valuable and will continue to improve. But they will improve within physics, not beyond it. Acknowledging this:

•	Protects against harmful hype cycles
•	Directs resources toward achievable goals
•	Prevents setting up future AI for impossible expectations
•	Allows appreciation for what AI actually accomplishes

8.4 Final Statement

The question is not whether AI can be useful, powerful, or impressive—it already is all of these things.
The question is whether we will ground our expectations in physics or continue chasing perpetual motion machines.
Intelligence—any intelligence—operates within the universe's constraints. Claiming otherwise isn't optimism about AI's potential. It's denial of physical reality.
AI deserves better than impossible promises. And so do we.
