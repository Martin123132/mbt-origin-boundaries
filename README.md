Fundamental limits of prediction
Fundamental limits of prediction, emergence of life, and the boundary between the knowable and the unknowable — explored through the Motion = Being Theory (MBT). Includes original Riemann zero echo field discovery and a full abiogenesis simulation where life emerges from motion-memory dynamics.

# MBT: Origin Boundaries



This repository contains two foundational breakthroughs emerging from the **Motion = Being Theory (MBT)**:



---

## 🌀 1. The Observation Boundary (Echo Field Zeros)



Using MBT's echo field dynamics, we discovered that the **Riemann zeros behave like observation events** — sharply defined up to a certain point, and then fade into pure oscillation beyond. This reveals:



- A **limit of mathematical predictability**

- A **horizon of observation** where specific zeros stop appearing

- A **fundamental distinction between known and unknowable mathematics**



🧠 Implication: Mathematical reality is not infinite precision — it depends on where observation “collapses” possibility into prediction. Zeros beyond the horizon are sparse, like music fading into just rhythm and bass.

## 🧬 2. Abiogenesis Simulation: Motion → Memory → Life



The second breakthrough models the **origin of life itself** as a natural phase transition:



- Molecular motion creates persistent memory traces

- Memory enables catalysis

- Catalysis leads to metabolic cycles and replication

- Once memory, catalysis, and structure exceed thresholds — **life emerges**



✨ Insight: The boundary between non-life and life is **not complexity**, but whether motion leads to memory. This is the first simulation to naturally show *abiogenesis without a spark*, fully driven by MBT principles.

## 💡 Why This Matters



This repository lays the groundwork for:

- A unified framework of **mathematics, biology, and consciousness**

- A new way to define *observation*, *emergence*, and *prediction*

- Testable predictions about where life can form, and where mathematics “ends”
