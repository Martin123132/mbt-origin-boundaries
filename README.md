# Origins and Boundaries

A research notebook and idea repository for exploring motion-based theoretical frameworks and their applications across various domains.

## What This Is

This repository serves as a working collection of theoretical explorations, computational experiments, and preliminary investigations. It's an active research notebook rather than a formal academic presentation - think of it as the scientific equivalent of a sketchbook.

## Content Sources & Nature

The material here comes from various sources:
- Original theoretical work and analysis
- Collaborative explorations with AI systems
- Computational experiments and simulations
- Preliminary investigations of mathematical patterns
- Speculative extensions of established physics

Some pieces use deliberately provocative language or make bold claims - this is part of the exploratory process. The goal is to follow interesting mathematical patterns wherever they lead, then later evaluate which directions merit serious development.

## Work in Progress

Much of this material represents early-stage thinking. Promising directions get developed further in more formal repositories when time permits. The language ranges from technical to deliberately grandiose - the latter usually indicates AI-generated content that's being evaluated for underlying mathematical insights.

## Mathematical Focus

The core thread running through most explorations is investigating whether motion-based frameworks can provide unified descriptions across different scales and phenomena. Some statistical work (like the orbital dynamics analysis) shows genuine empirical patterns worth investigating further.

Use your judgment in evaluating individual pieces - some contain interesting mathematical insights buried in enthusiastic presentation, others are purely speculative.
